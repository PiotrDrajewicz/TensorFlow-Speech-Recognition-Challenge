# TensorFlow-Speech-Recognition-Challenge
Algorithm which recognises certain speech commands.
## General info
This project is being made by taking part in TensorFlow's challenge in which you have to make algorithm that will achieve best recognition rate in speech recognition process. It's made on Google Colab platform with use of the neural network which processes spectrograms. Project isn't finished yet and I'm still developing it.
